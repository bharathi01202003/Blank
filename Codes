I hope you are doing well.

I would like to take a moment to clarify a few points regarding my current assignment and the full-time conversion process.

My tasks have been primarily handled under the supervision of Mr. Siva, with whom I maintain regular communication and ensure timely completion of all assigned responsibilities. However, I came to understand that his feedback may not have been taken into account during the full-time conversion evaluation. As he directly oversees my work, I believe his input would offer a more accurate reflection of my performance.

In terms of task allocation, I was initially informed that I would be working on activities related to APIs. However, upon further discussion with the team, I was informed that APIs are currently not being actively used. When I inquired about ongoing assignments, I was told that there is no active work at the moment and was advised to learn API-related concepts through online resources such as YouTube. I was also informed that tasks related to writing test cases may be assigned after a week.

I am sharing this for your awareness and transparency regarding the nature of my current involvement.

Thank you for your time and understanding

warm regards,
