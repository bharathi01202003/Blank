I am currently working as an intern in the Sun Screening Report project under the CEPIT department. Earlier, I was part of the Hobart project, where I worked on manual and automation testing under the guidance of Ms. Smruti Jain, and later contributed to development on a specific module under Mr. Naik Kapil Pravin, while continuing to report to Ms. Smruti Jain.

As my current assignment in the Sun Screening Report project is nearing completion, I have been informed that there are no immediate vacancies in the team. I am therefore reaching out to kindly inquire if there are any opportunities or vacancies in your team where I could contribute my skills and continue my learning.

I would be happy to share more details of my experience and discuss how I might fit into your teamâ€™s ongoing projects.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
